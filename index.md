### What is this project about? ###
MixWILD (Also Mixed model analysis with Intensive Longitudinal Data) is a desktop GUI-based application for examining the effects of variance and slope of time-varying variables in intensive longitudinal data, especially the ones collected using ecological momentary assessments.
